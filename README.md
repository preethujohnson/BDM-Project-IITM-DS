This project, titled "**Elevating Supermarket Profitability by Optimizing Sales and Inventory Data**" is part of my coursework for the **Business Data Management** module at **IIT Madras**, where I am pursuing a **Diploma in Data Science**. The focus of this project is to improve the operational efficiency and profitability of Minnus Super Store, a B2C supermarket in Thrissur, Kerala. Using transactional data spanning seven months and containing over 20,000 entries, I have analyzed key aspects such as product sales trends, inventory fluctuations, and revenue volatility due to seasonal demand. The dataset includes detailed records of product descriptions, quantities sold, net amounts, and invoice details, which were cleaned and categorized for further analysis. The primary objective is to optimize inventory management based on sales data to prevent both stock shortages and overstocking, while also providing actionable insights to enhance profitability. This project employs various business analytics techniques and serves as a practical application of the skills I have acquired during the course, with an emphasis on data-driven decision-making to resolve real-world business challenges.
